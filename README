ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This beginner-friendly machine learning project utilizes the classic Iris flower dataset, which includes measurements for three distinct species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The objective is to develop a classification model that predicts a flowerâ€™s species based on its sepal and petal dimensions.
ðŸ§  Goal
- Train a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers by species
- Explore supervised learning using labeled datasets
- Gain hands-on experience in data analysis and model evaluation
ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Data Preprocessing and Normalization
- Classification Algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Cross-Validation)
ðŸ“Š Dataset Details
- Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- Target Classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
âœ… Outcomes
- Visualize relationships between features and target classes
- Compare model performances and choose the best classifier
- Build an interpretable model for real-time species prediction
